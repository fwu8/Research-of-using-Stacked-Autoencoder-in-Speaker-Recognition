# Research-of-using-Stacked-Autoencoder-in-Speaker-Recognition
## About
A research project based on speaker recognition, using stacked ae to re-extract feature.
Note "feature" and "filter" file folder are mainly from https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/speaker-recognition/.
"interface.py", "skgmm.py", and "utils.py" are also from https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/speaker-recognition/.
Special thank Xinyu Zhou, Yuxin Wu, and Tiezheng Li from Tsinghua University, without their base work on speaker recognition, we cannot use their code and add feature re-extract part.
